## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 User-friendly Interface
- Minimalist **Tkinter-based GUI** with hover effects and modern design.
- Interactive input for symptoms.
- Modular AI response section with clear categorization.

### 🧠 AI-Powered Disease Prediction
- Machine Learning-based **disease prediction** using a trained SVC model.
- Real-time analysis of user-input symptoms.
- 100+ symptoms mapped to 40+ possible diseases.

### 📋 Detailed Recommendations
- Comprehensive **disease description** generated from the dataset.
- **Precautions** to help prevent worsening.
- **Medications** commonly prescribed for the disease.
- **Diet plans** tailored to the condition.
- Suggested **workout routines** to support recovery.

### 💬 Interactive AI Response Section
- Easy-to-use buttons to display:
  - 🦠 Disease name
  - 📋 Description
  - 😷 Precaution
  - 💊 Medications
  - 🍴 Diets
  - 🏃 Workouts

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** – for the GUI.
- **Scikit-learn** – SVC model for disease prediction.
- **Pandas** – for handling symptom, description, precaution, medication, and diet data.
- **NumPy** – for model input processing.
- **Pickle** – for loading trained models.

### Final Tips:

✅ When you generate a GIF:
- Use **ScreenToGif** or **LICEcap** to record a GIF of your app (entering symptoms → clicking analyze → displaying results).
- Upload it to **your GitHub repo** and link it like:  
  `![](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/blob/main/assets/demo.gif)`

✅ This format matches your **Stock Market README** very well — consistent branding across your projects!
